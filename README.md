# hello

It's called LIMUNY. Place where I learn about web back-end, from crimping UTP cable to RJ45 port and setting nginx just to work with sqlite. About 3 and a half I got lots of memories and experience that cry me when it's so usefull in my daily life. I love this place more than my class, hehe. Here I meet priceless unforgetable friends that support me to finish my study, even I got so many years spent to skip class. Thanks everybody there.

## This script

I forgot how and where I got this code. It's an alternative way of using GAS (Google Apps Script). Used for POB (Penerimaan Operator Baru) that need some form with Upload Function. At those time Google Forms can't do the job (it require login for uploader to use the function).
